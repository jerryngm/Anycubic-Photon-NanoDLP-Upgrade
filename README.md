üñ•Ô∏è **HDMI to MIPI Display Driver Board:**

- RBG 5.5 Inch screen, you will need to check your Photon and buy the appropriate board with the correct adapter for your screen (E.g X04 or X03)
     - [LS055R1SX04](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Abuelo) (New Photon Fauxton)
     - LS055R1SX03 (OG Photon) - You can order from the link above. However you will need to contact their customer service to include X03 adapter for you. Please note!! although both X03 and X04 connectors look the same, you can't use X03 for X04 and vice versa.
