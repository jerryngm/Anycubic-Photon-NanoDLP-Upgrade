🧰 Parts List
-	
🍓 **Raspberry Pi:**
 - [Raspberry Pi 3B+](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/)
 - or [Pi 4 model B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) (If you want to run 4K screen - future proof)
 - or even your computer (Windows, Linux, Mac) can also run nanoDLP
 
 🎛️ **NanoDLP official controller board:**

- [v1.2 board](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_A4PsSE), this board will fit on top of your Pi
	- [Kit with 3.5 Inch touch display](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_AqR32I)
- [v1.3 board](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_ABlmN0) - standalone, no touchscreen included, this board has PWN port for expansion (I’m using this one)
- or if  you want to reduce costs you can buy a RAMP and tinker with it.

🖥️ **HDMI to MIPI Display Driver Board:**

- RBG 5.5 Inch screen, you will need to check your Photon and buy the appropriate board with the correct adapter for your screen (E.g X04 or X03)
     - [LS055R1SX04](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Abuelo) (New Photon Fauxton)
     - LS055R1SX03 (OG Photon) - You can order from the link above. However you will need to contact their customer service to include X03 adapter for you. Please note!! although both X03 and X04 connectors look the same, you can't use X03 for X04 and vice versa.

- 2K - 4K RGB/Monoscreen controller board (Future proof)

🔗 **Cable**

 - a pack of at least 8 [Female-to-Female jumper wire](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_991QzY) if you purchased the V1.3 board

🕹️ **(Optional) Nextion touchscreen**
(Optional as NanoDLP can be controlled fully via its web interface)
 - [2.8 Inch](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_AMSOIS) (Anycubic Photon comes with 2.8 inch so I assume this would fit the slot)
 - Any other Nextion screen size support up to 7' (E.g. 3.5, 5.0, etc.)

Some of the link above is affiliated links from Aliexpress, when possible please order from those links as it would allow me to offset some cost of ordering wrong parts. Thank you 🥰
